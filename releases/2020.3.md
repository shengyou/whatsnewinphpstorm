## HTTP Client

* Guzzle integrated with HTTP client

  It'll be awesome to run Guzzle requests with the IDEâ€™s HTTP 
  client possible in one click. If the request is supported, 
  there will be a gutter icon next to it. Clicking it will 
  create a new scratch file with the correct URL, query 
  parameters, methods, headers, body, and simple auth.
